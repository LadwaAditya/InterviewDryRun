Question 2 - You want to open a map app from an app that you’re building. The address, city, state, and ZIP code are provided by the user. What steps are involved in sending that data to a map app?

Android offers Intents to communicate between Apps. More precisely we use implicit Intents to provide the Address data to the maps app.

These are the steps to be followed to achieve solution to the above problem

1) First create a String URI to pass the address 

String uri = "geo:0,0?q=ZIP+city+state";

2) Create an Intent with ACTION_VIEW action and the URI as the second parameter to the Intent

Intent intent = new Intent(android.content.Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(uri));

3) Start the activity passing the intent

startActivity(intent);


All wrapped in afunction

public void startMapActivity()
{
	String uri = "geo:0,0?q=ZIP+city+state";
	Intent intent = new Intent(android.content.Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(uri));
	startActivity(intent);
}
