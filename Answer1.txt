Question 1 - What’s your favorite tool or library for Android? Why is it so useful?

Glide is my favourite library that I use in almost every Android Project

Glide is an Image loading library recommended by Google. Glide is a image loading library that have features such as image, video or animated GIF loading, memory management of the images, decoding the images, resource pooling, caching.

Glide is open source and has an excellent documentation which was easy for me to get started. Glide has a fluent API and image loading can be achieved by just writing a few lines of code. Glide was written by Sam Judd and is open-sourced and have over 34 contributors. It is licensed under BSD, part MIT and Apache 2.0.
