Question 6 - What are your thoughts about Fragments? Do you like or hate them? Why?


Fragments are components that represent behaviour or a certain portion of user interface that we might want to abstract out.

Fragments are reusable components that are extensively used for dynamic UI management based on screen size(Multi-Pane Layout)

Personally, I love and also hate to use Fragments for the following reasons

Why I love them 
 *They are reusable components 
 *Excellent for creating dynamic UI
 
The reasons I hate to use fragments
 *Hard to manage the back-stack of the Fragments
 *Communicating back to the activity from the fragment requires us to create an interface which i think is a lot of code for just to get a few things work
